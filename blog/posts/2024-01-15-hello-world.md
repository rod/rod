description: The first post — a brief note on starting.
---

Every site starts somewhere. This is that somewhere.

<!-- more -->

I've been meaning to put something here for a while. A place to think out loud, to share notes on software and life, without the noise of a platform that wants my attention in return.

The design is intentionally sparse. No tracking scripts, no newsletter pop-ups, no cookie banners. Just text.

## Why bother?

Writing is thinking. Putting ideas in a form that someone else might read forces a clarity that a private journal doesn't. Even if nobody reads this — the act of writing for an imagined reader is useful.

## What to expect

Irregular posts on:

- Software development, tooling, and open source
- Simplicity as a design principle
- Things I'm reading or building

No schedule. No niche. Just whatever seems worth writing down.
