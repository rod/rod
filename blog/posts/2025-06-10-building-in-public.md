description: Notes on shipping work before it feels ready.

The hardest part of building something is showing it before it's finished.

<!-- more -->

Finished is a fiction anyway. Every shipped product is a snapshot of an ongoing process — a decision to stop iterating at a particular moment and call it good enough.

## The reluctance

There's a specific kind of paralysis that comes from working on something for a while: the longer you've spent, the higher your standards become, and the further away "ready" feels. The project that started as a quick weekend thing becomes a thing you're too close to, too invested in to release.

## What building in public does

Sharing work in progress — even rough notes, even half-finished tools — breaks that loop. It:

1. Creates a forcing function. If someone can see it, you have to make decisions.
2. Gets you feedback before you've over-committed to any one direction.
3. Makes the work real. A thing that exists only on your laptop is easy to ignore; a thing that's out there is a responsibility.

## The practice

I've started treating small releases like commits: frequent, incremental, not necessarily polished. A post is done when it says the thing it's trying to say, not when every sentence is perfect.

This site is an example. It's minimal on purpose. It will change. That's fine.
